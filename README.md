# Especial Project for Data Structure and Algorithm course instructed by [Dr.Alireza Bagheri](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2072/Alireza%20Bagheri)
## Navigation-Project
Using Dijkstra Algorithm to implement a navigation project

### how it works

 By the use of Dijkstra algorithm, it calculates the cost of each path and gives the optimal path to get to destination.
 It considers the traffic and weight of each path and the time each member wants to start driving. 
 It also tells you how much time it takes to get to the destinations.
